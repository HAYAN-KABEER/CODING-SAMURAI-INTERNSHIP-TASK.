# Sales Predictions Using Basic Models

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to **predict future sales based on historical trends**. By analyzing past sales data, we aim to identify patterns and provide actionable insights for better business decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains the following key columns:
- **Date**: Date of the transaction  
- **Product / SKU**: Name or ID of the product  
- **Quantity (Qty)**: Number of units sold  
- **Price / Amount**: Price per unit or total sales amount  

> Note: The dataset may contain missing values which are handled during preprocessing.

## Project Tasks
1. **Trend Analysis**  
   - Aggregate monthly sales to identify patterns.  
   - Calculate **moving averages** to smooth short-term fluctuations.  

2. **Visualization**  
   - Line chart showing monthly sales trends.  
   - 3-Month moving average overlay to highlight trend.  
   - Product-wise and category-wise sales visualizations.  
   - Cumulative sales and heatmap for deeper insights.  

3. **Forecasting**  
   - Predict next month’s sales using **basic linear trend models**.  
   - Provide actionable suggestions based on observed trends (e.g., stock planning, promotions).

## Tools Used
- **Python**  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`  
- **Excel / Google Sheets** (optional for analysis or visualization)

## Key Insights
- Top-performing products and categories identified.  
- Seasonal trends observed for specific months.  
- Simple linear regression and moving averages provide a basic forecast for next month’s sales.  
- Recommendations can help in inventory planning, marketing strategies, and sales optimization.
